# Tic Tac Boom aka Tic Tac Toe

## Background
Tic Tac Boom is the first small project I developed during General Assembly's Web Development Immersive course.
It was developed with a mobile-first approach in mind and uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images and sound files.

## How to play
- Visit https://melber.github.io/tictactoe/ (ideally on your mobile) and make sure to turn the volume up.
- The game automatically selects by random which of the two player starts; the next player's avatar will jump up and down.
- Beneath each player is a counter of their points.
- Once a player reaches 3 points, the game is won.
- The game will then count down from 5 and start a new game automatically.
